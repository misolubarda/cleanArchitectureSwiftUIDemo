# Clean architecture demo
This project represents one of possible implementations of clean architecture in iOS. It is based on the knowledge, found in the book "Clean architecture" by Robert C. Martin, and my experience with implementations in different projects. It should not be mistaken or compared with MVC, MVVM, MVP and similar design patterns which can all be part of the same architecture.
